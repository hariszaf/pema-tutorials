PEMA ([*Zafeiropoulos et al.* 2020](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/9/3/giaa022/5803335))
supports the complete analysis of 4 marker genes: 16S/18S/12S rRNA, ITS and COI.
In its latest version a new module was added to enable the use of custom reference databases. 
You may find more about PEMA on its [documentation site](http://pema.hcmr.gr/)
